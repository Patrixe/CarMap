*********** Semantically annotated with a DIFF 3D Map **************
Features:
1. Austerity-generated 3D map (20x smaller map than ORB-SLAM2)
2. Austerity-generated 3D map upload/download to the central mapping server
3. Feature map stitching for Austerity generated map (comparable stitching performance to QuickSketch)
4. Semantically annotated map featuring map-points with labels from DeepLab trained on the CityScape dataset
5. Diff operation that finds the difference between two semantically annotated maps in the same region
6. Working on the semantic segmentation pipeline
7. Evaluating for the MobiCom paper
8. Evaluating for NSDI paper
